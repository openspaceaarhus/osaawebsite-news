# Make your own X-mas decorations from computer parts

A free workshop at Open Space Aarhus (OSAA), Aarhus’s one and only hackspace [https://www.osaa.dk/](https://www.osaa.dk//)

Hacker Klaartje Bruyn (aka Moem), visiting Aarhus from the Netherlands, shows you and helps you make your own Christmas decorations using parts of hard disks, copper wire, CD’s and whatnot.

Tools and materials are available in OSAA. However, you can bring your old computer if you want to get rid of it, so we can ”harvest” the parts for the Christmas decorations.

Language: mostly English, some Danish, some Dutch.

When:Tuesday 20 November, from 19.00 – 21.00 hrs.

Where:Open Space Aarhus, Bryggervej 30, 8240 Aarhus N [http://find.osaa.dk](http://find.osaa.dk/)

It is fun! It is cheap! It is sustainable! Reach out to your creativity and inner nerd!
