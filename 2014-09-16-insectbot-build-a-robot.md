Who wants to build a robot? On 25 September, 18.30-21.30 Habib visits Aarhus and is willing to give a workshop for Switch ‘n Bitch – you pay 150 kr for both workshop and materials. Suitable for children of all ages. The workshop will be in English!

Look here for description of the robot kit: http://dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product%2Fproduct&amp;product\_id=1055

Sign up for the workshop on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/453726614770392/

If you don’t like/use Facebook, leave me a message: inger.stokkink@gmail.com

There should come a SafeTicket-account soon, so you can pay and confirm.

Finally, have a look at Habib’s Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/bbmakers/?fref=ts
