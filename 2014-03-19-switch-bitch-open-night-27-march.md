It’s time to release your inner nerd again – or is it time to bring out your inner magpie, because it is spring, and you like baubles and bling? One way or the other, come and join us at Switch &amp; Bitch Open Night at OSAA! We start at 19.00 hrs., and steadily work on until 21.30 hrs.

We play with innards of computers, making jewellery and decorations out of them.

We also harvest interesting parts from computers, computer parts like hard disks, and other electronic devices.

Have a look at the Switch and Bitch Facebook group, and see what we have been up to so far: <span style="color: #000080;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><https://www.facebook.com/groups/Sw1tchandB1tch/></span></span>
