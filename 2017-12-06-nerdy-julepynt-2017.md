Christmas unleashes creativity in many people. And nerds are people, too. So come to Open Space Aarhus, the one and only hackerspace in town, and see what happens when creativity and technology meet!

There are lots of bling bling computer parts, just waiting for you to transform them into shiny pretty Christmas decorations with an edge.

To get you started, we have developed a dead-easy project involving hard disks, Sugru, a battery and LEDs. The result is a pendant for your Christmas tree, giving it a geeky twist.

After that, go ‘shopping’ in the treasure chests of OSAA to make other decorations.

Or relax, drink a coffee, nibble some cookies and see what other activities OSAA has on offer to the technologically inclined.

Or harvest computer parts yourself – we have a couple of harddisks and laptops lying about for unscrewing. You can also bring your own pensioned-off computers or laptops.
