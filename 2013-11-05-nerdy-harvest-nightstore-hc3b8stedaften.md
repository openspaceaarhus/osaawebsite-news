Our plan for today is to ‘harvest’ parts from computers and other electronic devices, in order to use those parts on 12 December in the Nerdy Julepynt Workshop.

Always wanted to look inside a computer? Or wanted to destroy one with a screwdriver (or otherwise)? You can also bring stuff you want to open up in a responsible way – who knows what treasures it hides inside…

Date &amp; time: Thursday 14 November, 18-21.00 hrs.  
Place: Open Space Aarhus, Bryggervej 30, 8240 Aarhus  
Entrance: free  
Languages spoken: Danish, English, Rumenian, Dutch
