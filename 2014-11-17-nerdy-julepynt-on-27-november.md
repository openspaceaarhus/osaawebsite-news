Sw1tch &amp; B1tch is proud to be present Nerdy Julepynt! A workshop where you can make Christmas decorations with computer parts â€“ thus releasing your inner nerd ðŸ™‚

We have lots of pretty computer bling lying about, but feel free to bring your own (old) computer for a nice unscrewing session â€“ we can help you with that. Because we have loads of tools, too!

And oh: itâ€™s European Waste Reduction Week that week ðŸ™‚ [http://www.ewwr.eu/en](http://www.ewwr.eu/en "http://www.ewwr.eu/en")

The workshop is free, but please sign up via Facebook here: [https://www.facebook.com/events/1523740367877091/](https://www.facebook.com/events/1523740367877091/ "https://www.facebook.com/events/1523740367877091/")
