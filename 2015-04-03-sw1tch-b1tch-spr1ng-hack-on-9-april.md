It’s been some time since we hacked. So let’s get together and get a project or two going!

Our aim is to make jewellery (or some other form of decoration) out of computer parts. Over the winter, some new bling has found its way to Sw1tch&amp;B1tch’s treasure chest, so come and check it out. And if you have something that needs to be unscrewed, bring it and we’ll find out what goodies are hidden inside.

Date: Thursday, 9 april  
Time: 19-21.30 hrs.
