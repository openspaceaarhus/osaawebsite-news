**Bitch &amp; Switch , Tuesday 16 april, 19-22 hrs.**   
The third Tuesday of the month is coming up – time to come and play with computer parts at Open Space Aarhus, a.k.a. soft-hacking!

The focus is on making jewelry – why not a tiara, in honour of the Danish Queen’s birthday?

But you are also welcome to make a pair of earrings from harddisk parts and resistors, a wind chime from harddisks… or let your imagination run wild with the shiny and pretty objects we managed to clean from computers…

Feel free to bring computers or other electronic gear to be dissected.

Language: both English and Danish, whichever suits you best.
