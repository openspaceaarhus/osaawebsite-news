Summer holidays are over, so it’s time for some general switchin’ and bitchin’. We’ll play with computer parts, do the Danish hygge thing and make plans for the coming season. If you have suggestions for projects or workshops, then don’t hold back and come forward with them! We’ll meet at 19.00 hrs.

Have a look at our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Sw1tchandB1tch/) and join in the conversation. If you don’t do Facebook, leave a message in the comments here.

Suggestions until now:

\* Do something in the efterårsferie (week 42), also in connection with International Ada Lovelace Day (14 October)  
\* Do something with mobiles  
\* Nerdy Julepynt – make Christmas decorations from computer parts  
\* Nerdy Parent-Child Afternoon on a Sunday or a Saturday

*… to be continued…*
