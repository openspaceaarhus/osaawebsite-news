Good news! Habib Belaribi from BBmakers in France comes to Denmark after all, so the earlier announced workshop will take place on Saturday, 25 October, from 16.00 hrs.-18.30 hrs. Build your own robot â€“ and apply some upcycling, if you want to ðŸ™‚  
Same conditions as the earlier announced workshop: 150 kr for both workshop and materials. There are 10 places available, of which 5 places are taken up, so first come, first served!

Or send me an email, and I will send you the details so you can pay for the kit beforehand (because I donâ€™t do cash on the day itself).
