## *Autodetermination, liberty and sustainability in the anthropocene*

## Open call

In the weekend of November 22.-23. we’re organizing an encounter with the purpose of strengthening and enhancing the networks created at the 1st International Festival for Technoshamanism, which took place on April 23-30 in Arraial d’Ajuda, Bahia, Brazil.

As in the festival in Brazil, the focus will be on solutions for the anthropocene, e.g., recycling, permaculture, conservation of nature, reactions to climate change and the possible benefits of ancestral knowledge (e.g., of South American indigenous people) in addressing our situation today.

The focus will be not only academic but also practical, noting the potential of free technology and free software, up to and including DIY space travel.

The Brazilian artist, writer and activist [Fabiane Borges](http://catahistorias.wordpress.com/), who organized the festival in Brazil with [George Sander](http://saltonovazio.wordpress.com/), is visiting Denmark a few days in November and will be present at the event and will be able to tell us about her work with technoshamanism in South America as well as about the scene for DIY space culture.  
Things we’d already like to discuss during the encounter are

- The status of nature conservation in Denmark (and other places)
- Permaculture as a real alternative to the agricultural industry and an efficient strategy against climate change
- Hardware workshops, e.g. in controlling the ambience in a greenhouse or a dwelling to save and manage energy
- The use of free software and free culture in general to further independent cultures and thus enhance cultural diversity
- Discussions around ontology, mythology, philosophy, animism, biodiversity and the role of ancestral knowledge
- Self-maintained infrastructures – DIY in general, free software, space culture
- More artistic performances, music, dance, etc., as per your proposal, including an improvised musical ritual in the hackerspace
- Your own proposal

The encounter will take place in **Open Space Aarhus, Katrinebjergvej 105, 8200 Aarhus N** on the **22.-23. of november at 17:00-21:00 hours.**

Please come and bring a friend! If you wish to propose an activity, please send your proposal by email to *<agger@modspil.dk>*
