On Thursday, September 24, OSAA will be the setting of Denmark’s first ever [LibreOffice Hackfest](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Aarhus2015). At the time of writing, there’s 42 registered attendees.

And the good news is: Everyone is welcome!

The event will focus on “C++11 in LibreOffice” and on bug triaging and [bibisecting](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/QA/Bibisect). There’s going to be drinks, snacks and [dinner](http://conference.libreoffice.org/2015/events/hack-fest-and-party/) available.

- Just before the event starts, the Aarhus C++ User’s Group will have a brief meeting in the space.
- There will be non-alcoholic drinks, beer and snacks
- Concurrently, there will be a party for the non-hacking LibreOffice community in the Nygaard building just across the street, in the University’s Department of Computer Science.
