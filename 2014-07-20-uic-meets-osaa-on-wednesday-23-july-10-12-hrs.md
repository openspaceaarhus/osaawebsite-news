The University International Club ([UIC](http://ias.au.dk/uic/ "University International Club")) of Aarhus University visits OSAA this fine summer morning. Members of UIC come from all countries over the world, and from Denmark, too. The aim of UIC is to make newcomers feel at home as quick as possible, and to show interesting places them around Aarhus. Of course OSAA features among those attractions ðŸ™‚

The introduction is somewhat Switch&amp;Bitch-oriented because of there being quite a lot of women among the members of UIC, buth this should not keep real nerds away from OSAA.
