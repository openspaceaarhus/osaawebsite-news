Itâ€™s that time of the month again ðŸ™‚

Switch &amp; Bitch meets every fourth Thursday of the month at OSAA, from 19.00 to 21.30 hrs. Release your inner nerd, unscrew some computers and let your fantasy do the rest!

This time there is no special workshop, just time to work on your own projects, look what others are doing, socialising, whatever.

If there is interest in working some more with the laser cutter and the Inkscape computer programme for designing, we could organise another workshop. Leave a message here or at Switch &amp; Bitchâ€™s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Sw1tchandB1tch/)

By the way, we now also have a Pinterest account for inspiration, exchange and possible future projects, look here: [sw1tchnb1tch OSAA](http://www.pinterest.com/ingerstokkink/)

â€¦ and we gladly receive more old harddisks ðŸ™‚
