Sadly enough, the workshop on Thursday 25 September, from 18.30 to 21.30 hrs., is cancelled because Habib is not coming to Denmark. That is the bad news. The good news is that he will be coming some time later, probably October. Watch this space (ha!) for updates.

Meanwhile, Sw1tch&amp;B1tch will be improvising this coming Thursday. It will be freestyle jewelry making (our standard fare) but for those who are interested in something different, I am hereby announcing a Loom workshop. [Loom](http://loomlove.com/) is a big hit in the Netherlands for children. I bought a set of rubberbands and a Loom board some time ago, so letâ€™s find out about it!

Oh, bring a fork.
