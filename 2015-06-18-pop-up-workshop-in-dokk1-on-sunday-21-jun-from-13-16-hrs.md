Switch&amp;Bitch has been invited to give a workshop in DOKK1 (aka Hovedbiblioteket). Come and join in the fun, if you feel like making nerdy jewelry, or just like deconstructing a hard disk or a laptop (laptops kindly supplied by The English Bookshop). Feel free to bring your own appliances for deconstruction, and release your inner nerd!

(Danish and English spoken)
